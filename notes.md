feature_map = ZZFeatureMap(feature_dimension=2, reps=1)

# Initialize QSVM with quantum simulator backend
qsvc = QSVC(feature_map=feature_map, quantum_instance=Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'))

# Train Quantum SVM
qsvc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test predictions
y_pred = qsvc.predict(X_test)

# Accuracy output
accuracy = (y_pred == y_test).mean()
print(f'Quantum SVM test accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```

### Deployment Instructions

- Install dependencies:  
  ```bash
  pip install qiskit qiskit-machine-learning scikit-learn
  ```
- Run the script. Replace synthetic data with your own IoC or security feature datasets.  
- For real quantum hardware execution, set `quantum_instance` to backends like `IBMQ.get_backend('ibmq_qasm_simulator')` after setting up IBM Quantum account and API.

## 3. Deepfake Detection Pipeline Using TensorFlow/Keras

### CNN Model for Image-based Deepfake Detection

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Model architecture
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Data augmentation and loading
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255,
                                   horizontal_flip=True,
                                   zoom_range=0.2,
                                   shear_range=0.2)

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'data/train',
    target_size=(128, 128),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='binary'
)

val_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
validation_generator = val_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'data/validation',
    target_size=(128, 128),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='binary'
)

# Train model
model.fit(
    train_generator,
    epochs=15,
    validation_data=validation_generator
)
```

### Dataset Recommendations & Instructions

- Popular datasets:  
  - **FaceForensics++** (https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics)  
  - **DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset** on Kaggle  
- Download datasets and organize into folders as:  
  ```
  data/
    train/
      real/
      fake/
    validation/
      real/
      fake/
  ```
- Use GPU-enabled environment (Google Colab, AWS, Azure) for faster training.
- Extend for video/audio modalities by integrating temporal or audio feature extractors.

***

If you want, I can provide:

- Sample n8n credentials and environment variable setup steps.
- Quantum ML dataset preprocessing scripts.
- Advanced multi-modal deepfake detection models and evaluation metrics.

Please specify which deeper detail you want next!



Here are detailed guides and sample configurations for each requested item:

***

## 1. Sample n8n Credentials and Environment Variable Setup

### Using Environment Variables in n8n

- Store API keys and URLs as environment variables for security.

Create a `.env` file or configure your environment with:

```bash
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://yourdomain.com/
QUANTUM_INTEL_API_KEY=your-quantum-threat-feed-api-key
SIEM_API_URL=https://siem.yourorg.com/api/alerts
SIEM_API_TOKEN=your-siem-api-token
```

### Using Environment Variables in Workflow Nodes

In the HTTP Request node parameters, reference environment variables as:

```js
url: '={{ $env.QUANTUM_INTEL_API_URL || "https://api.quantumthreatintel.com/feed/latest" }}',
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer {{$env.QUANTUM_INTEL_API_KEY}}`
}
```

***

## 2. Quantum ML Dataset Preprocessing Scripts (Python)

Example to preprocess network security data for quantum ML:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Load raw IoC or security dataset CSV
data = pd.read_csv('ioc_raw_data.csv')

# Select relevant features (e.g., traffic bytes, packet count)
features = data[['packet_size', 'duration', 'source_port', 'dest_port']]

# Normalize data in [0,1] (important for quantum feature map inputs)
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features)

# Convert to numpy array for quantum ML input
import numpy as np
X = np.array(features_scaled)

# Labels for anomaly or compromise classification
y = data['is_malicious'].values

# Save processed dataset
np.save('quantum_ml_X.npy', X)
np.save('quantum_ml_y.npy', y)

print("Preprocessed quantum ML dataset saved.")
```

***

## 3. Advanced Multi-Modal Deepfake Detection Models & Evaluation Metrics

### Example Architectural Components

- **Visual Stream:** 3D CNN or hybrid CNN-LSTM to capture spatial and temporal features in video frames.
- **Audio Stream:** Spectrogram CNN or transformer to analyze voice and audio authenticity.
- **Fusion Layer:** Combine visual and audio feature embeddings using concatenation or attention.
- **Classifier:** Dense layers + sigmoid/softmax output for binary/multi-class classification.

***

### Example TensorFlow Model Snippet (Multi-Modal Fusion)

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import Input, Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, LSTM, Dense, Flatten, Concatenate

# Visual branch: CNN + LSTM
visual_input = Input(shape=(30, 128, 128, 3))  # 30 frames sequence
x = tf.keras.layers.TimeDistributed(Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu'))(visual_input)
x = tf.keras.layers.TimeDistributed(Flatten())(x)
x = LSTM(64)(x)

# Audio branch: CNN on spectrogram input
audio_input = Input(shape=(128, 128, 1))
y = Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu')(audio_input)
y = Flatten()(y)

# Fusion and classification
combined = Concatenate()([x, y])
z = Dense(64, activation='relu')(combined)
output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(z)

model = Model(inputs=[visual_input, audio_input], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

***

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score:** Especially important for imbalanced fake/real classes.
- **ROC-AUC:** Discrimination capability.
- **Confusion Matrix:** True positive, false positive rates analysis.
- **Cross-validation:** To measure model robustness.

    }
    ```

- Use **n8n Credentials System** for centralized secure storage (can encrypt credentials).
